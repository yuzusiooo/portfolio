                            Revolve Engine 120 is a fast-paced arcade shooter where you circle around an incoming enemy horde, get quick kills to stack up combos and aim for the highest score in 120 miuntes.

                            <b>About this project</b>
                            <p>
                                I made this game in between university semesters, as a way to practice game development in Godot. I wanted to make something that had a larger scale than game prototypes, and this was my attempt to make a game that was more complete and polished. It took about 6 months of development to get from the initial prototype to where the game is now.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I put a lot of effort in the game's visuals and the visual and audio feedbacks so it feels good to play. This was the first time I have used shaders extensively and I was able to make the game look more polished.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It did feel like the game's scope was too big for the time I initially allocated, so I think the game could use some balancing and reevaluation of the gameplay loop, but it was a good learning experience in terms of coding practices, project structures and time management.
