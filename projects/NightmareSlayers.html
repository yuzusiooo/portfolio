                            Nightmare Slayers is a Third Person Shooter where you play as 3 different characters, each with unique playstyles.<br>
                            Fly through the dream world as the Nightmare Slayers, use your weapons and abilities to shoot, dodge and defeat the demon horde.

                            <b>About this project</b>
                            <p>
                                This game was made for the Game Design Studio groupwork task, where I, and 3 others, were tasked to design and develop a game in 8 weeks. We would work on the game in a daily basis, and every 2 weeks a playtest session is done where we analyse the feedbacks and assess future plans.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is one of my favourite projects that I have worked on, since our group was always communicating and working on the game, and it really felt like a collaborative effort that paid off very well in the end.<br>
                                We put a lot of effort into the shooting and flying actions, and we were able to get consistent feedbacks that our game was unique, polished and fun to play.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We were able to attend to a student project showcase event at our university, and our game was played by various students and guests from the industry.<br>
                                Given more time, I think we could have fixed some balance issues and polish the atmosphere more, but I am happy that I was able to be part of this game.
